#### US Census Data 

#### R package tidycensus

```{r, out.width="%10"}
knitr::include_graphics("logo/tidycensus.png")
```

- [`R  tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) package allows users to interface with the [US Census Bureau's](https://www.census.gov/en.html):
  - Decennial Census and 
  - Five-year American Community data 
- return `tidyverse-ready` data frames.

- Note that: ACS data differ from decennial Census data as they are based on an annual sample of approximately 3 million households, rather than a more complete enumeration of the US population.

- Install the package with the following commands:

```{r}
#install.packages("tidycensus")
```

- To get started working with `tidycensus`, users should load the package along with the 
`tidyverse` package, and set their **Census API key**. 
- A key can be obtained from http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15248815/rgdal-package-installation
#for macOs users
#install.packages('rgdal', type = "source", configure.args=c('--with-proj-include=/usr/local/include','--with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib'))
#set your API key.
census_api_key("9d72c8e5767036d483cb20293bd3960c005a2f53", overwrite=TRUE, install=TRUE)
```

- The basic usage of `tidycensus` is available at: https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html.

- There are two major functions implemented in tidycensus:

   - `get_decennial(geography, variables, year)` : grants access to the **2000 and 2010 decennial US Census APIs**, and 
   - `get_acs(geography, variables, year)`: grants access to the **1-year and 5-year American Community Survey APIs**.
  
#### State-level map of U.S. median income data from the 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS)

- First, we will obtain the sate-level income data from the 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) 
from the `tidycensus` package and make a **state-level** map of U.S. **median income data**. 
 
- A small note: The American Community Survey (ACS) helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses 
  understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population 
  and housing information about the nation.

```{r}
data <- get_acs(geography = "state") 
View(data)
```

- Getting variables from the Census or ACS requires knowing the variable ID - and there are 
thousands of these IDs across the different Census files. To rapidly search for variables, 
use the `load_variables()` function. 

```{r}
#https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html
v18 <- load_variables(dataset = "acs5", year = 2018)  #year:endyear of the ACS, dataset:acs1, acs5
View(v18)
#"B19013_001" = Median household income in the past
```

- Get the data now and drop if there is any NA.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=F}
library(tidyr)
us_state_income <- get_acs(geography = "state", 
                           variables = c(median_income = "B19013_001"), year = 2018) %>% #call the variable as median_income
                           drop_na()
              
View(us_state_income)
#https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf
```

- The function returns a tibble with columns by default: 
  - `GEOID`: which is an identifier for the geographical unit associated with the row, 
  - `NAME`: which is a descriptive name of the geographical unit; variable, 
  - `variable`: which is the Census variable represented in the row, and 
  - `ESTIMATE`: which is the value of the variable for that unit.
  
- Note that: ACS data do not represent precise counts of population subgroups, but are rather designed to give a general sense of how socioeconomic indicators vary across the country.

#### Retrieving Shape files

#### R package tigris

```{r, out.width="%50"}
knitr::include_graphics("logo/tigris.png")
```

- The core TIGER/Line Files and Shapefiles, which contain geographic entity codes (GEOIDs) 
that can be linked to the Census Bureau’s demographic data is available at https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html.

- [`R tigris`](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package allows users to directly download 
and use TIGER/Line and shapefiles (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) 
from the US Census Bureau.

- Install and load the package with the following commands:

```{r}
#install.packages("tigris")
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

- The `states` function allows us to download the shape files.

```{r}
#If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k) states file. Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file)
state <- states(cb = TRUE, resolution = "20m") 
View(state)
```

```{r}
class(state)
```

- Now it is time to merge spatial data set **state** with a regular data set **us_state_income**.
- We used `merge` from `sf` package in previous examples. 
- The function `geo_join(spatial_data, data_frame, by_sp, by_df)` from `tigris` package also allows
us to do this.

```{r}
income_data <- state %>% 
                 geo_join(us_state_income, by_sp = "GEOID", by_df = "GEOID")
                   #by_sp: The column name you'll use for the merge from your spatial data frame.
                   #by_df: The column name you'll use for the merge from your regular data frame.	


View(income_data)
```


```{r}
class(income_data)
```


#### Web Mapping

- The [`R leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package provides 
bindings to the ‘Leaflet’ [JavaScript library](https://leafletjs.com/), 
“the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps”. 
- Visit the page at https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/ for detailed features.

- We have already seen a simple use of `leaflet` in the `tmap` examples.
- The good and bad news is that the leaflet library gives us lots of options 
to customize the web look and feel of the map.

- First we install and load the leaflet library. 

```{r}
#install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)
```

- Once installed, you can use this package at the `R console`,
within `R Markdown` documents, and within `Shiny applications`.


#### Basic Usage

- You create a **Leaflet map** with these basic steps:
  - Create a map widget by calling `leaflet()` function with an **sf** object.
  - Add layers to the map by using layer functions:
    - `addPolygons()`: Add polygons to the map.
    - `addTiles()`: Add a tile layer to the map.
    - `addMarkers()`: Add markers to the map.
    - `addPopups()`: Add popups to the map.
    - `addCircles()`: Add circles to the map.
  - Use the pipe operator %>% to chain the elements together when building up a map with leaflet.
  - Print the map widget to display it.
- More at: https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html



```{r}
# leaflet does require us to explicitly reproject the sf object.
# Otherwise throws an error.
library(sf)
st_crs(income_data)  #EPSG:4269 
```

- Transform crs to 4326.

```{r}
income_data_WGS84 <- st_transform(income_data, crs = 4326)
```


```{r}
income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>%  
           addPolygons(color="black") #color="black", weight=1, fillColor="white"
```


```{r}
## Set value for the minZoom and maxZoom settings.
#leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 18))

#colorNumeric: Conveniently maps data values (numeric or factor/character) to colors according to a given palette, which can be provided in a variety of formats.

#colorFactor() in HW2!!!.

pal_col <- colorNumeric(palette="Purples", domain = income_data_WGS84$estimate) 

#domain = income_data_WGS84$estimate: to be consistent over multiple calls. otherwise
#it may give different hex colors from "Purples" pallette.
    
map1 <- income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>%  
           addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, #remove polygon borders
                       fillColor = ~pal_col(estimate)) # set fill color with function from above and estimate value
                       

map1
```


```{r}
class(map1)
```

- Add a basemap and fit the map into a box within predefined coordinates.

```{r}
map2 <- income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>% 
          addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, 
                       fillColor = ~pal_col(estimate)) %>% 
            #a point on the on the south west and a point on the north east.
            #with two points, it draws a surrounding rectangular.
          fitBounds(lng1=-124.848974, lat1=24.396308, 
                    lng2=-66.885444,  lat2=49.384358) %>% #fit the map into a box
#https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-longitude-and-latitude-of-a-bounding-box-around-the-continental-United-States
          addTiles()  #add base map where default is OSM.
map2
```

- Increase the opacity of colors.

```{r}
map3 <- income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>% 
           addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, 
                       fillColor = ~pal_col(estimate),
                       fillOpacity = 0.8)  %>% 
            fitBounds(lng1=-124.848974, lat1=24.396308, 
                      lng2=-66.885444,  lat2=49.384358) %>% 
             addTiles() 
          
       
map3
```


- Add legend.

```{r}
map4 <- income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>% 
          addTiles() %>% 
           addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, 
                       fillColor = ~pal_col(estimate),
                       fillOpacity = 0.8)  %>% 
             fitBounds(lng1=-124.848974, lat1=24.396308, 
                       lng2=-66.885444,  lat2=49.384358)  %>% 
            addLegend("bottomright",  # location
                       pal=pal_col,    # palette function
                       values=~estimate,  # value to be passed to palette function
                      title = 'Median Household Income') # legend title       
map4
```


- Finally, add `labels` with label argument in `addPolygons()` layer.
    - `labels`: a character vector of the **HTML content** for the labels.

```{r}
#A wrapper for the C function sprintf, that returns a character vector containing a formatted #combination of text and variable values.

labels <-  sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/> Income: %s $", income_data_WGS84$NAME.x, income_data_WGS84$estimate) %>%
            lapply(htmltools::HTML)  #converts it into a HTML content
 
#Answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11623224/what-does-s-mean-in-php-html-or-xml

map5 <- income_data_WGS84 %>% 
          leaflet() %>% 
          addTiles() %>% 
           addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, 
                       fillColor = ~pal_col(estimate),
                       fillOpacity = 0.8,
                       label = labels)  %>% 
             fitBounds(lng1=-124.848974, lat1=24.396308, 
                       lng2=-66.885444,  lat2=49.384358)  %>% 
addLegend("bottomright",  # location
            pal=pal_col,    # palette function
            values=~estimate,  # value to be passed to palette function
            title = 'Median Household Income') # legend title       
map5

```
